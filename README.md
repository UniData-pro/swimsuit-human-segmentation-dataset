# People Clothing Segmentation Dataset
Dataset comprises 14,358 high-quality photos of 7,179 people of diverse genders wearing bathing suits, each paired with detailed segmentation masks for precise body-parts segmentation. It designed for semantic and instance segmentation tasks, this large-scale collection offers manually annotated labels, enabling robust training for deep learning models in human body analysis.

By leveraging this dataset, researchers can train high-precision segmentation models to accurately delineate human bodies in swimwear under various real-world conditions. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/swimsuit-human-segmentation-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=swimsuit-human-segmentation-dataset)**
